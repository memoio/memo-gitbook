## What is ERC-7829?

**ERC-7829**, titled "Data Asset NFT," is a proposed Ethereum token standard that extends the existing ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard. It is designed to represent data assets as NFTs, enabling more structured and secure management of digital data on the blockchain.

**Key Features:**

* **Backward Compatibility**: ERC-7829 builds upon and remains compatible with the ERC-721 standard, ensuring interoperability with existing NFT infrastructures.

* **Integration with Modular Data Layers**: The standard emphasizes the importance of integrating with modular data layers (DA) to ensure the security and accessibility of data assets, especially in untrusted environments.

* **Enhanced Data Representation**: By representing data assets as NFTs, ERC-7829 facilitates better tracking, ownership, and transfer of digital data, aligning with the principles of decentralized data management.

ERC-7829 aims to provide a standardized approach to handling data assets on the Ethereum blockchain, promoting secure and efficient data management practices within decentralized applications.
