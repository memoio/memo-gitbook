The contract code： `https://github.com/memoio/did-solidity.git` (not yet public)
The contract go code converted by `abigen` is located in `https://github.com/memoio/did-solidity.git/tree/memoda/go-contracts`.

The user constructs a `FileProofProxy` contract instance through the `FileProofProxy` contract address and directly calls the `FileProofProxy` contract instance to interact with the `FileProof` contract.
