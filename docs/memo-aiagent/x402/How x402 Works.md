This page explains the complete payment flow in x402, from initial request to payment settlement.

### Overview

x402 enables programmatic payments over HTTP using a simple request-response flow. When a client requests a paid resource, the server responds with payment requirements, the client submits payment, and the server delivers the resource.

### Interaction Flow

1. `Client` makes an HTTP request to a `resource server`
2. `Resource server` responds with a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.
3. `Client` selects one of the `paymentDetails` returned by the `accepts` field of the server response and creates a `Payment Payload` based on the `scheme` of the `paymentDetails` they have selected.
4. `Client` sends the HTTP request with the `X-PAYMENT` header containing the `Payment Payload` to the `resource server`
5. `Resource server` verifies the `Payment Payload` is valid either via local verification or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment Details` to the `/verify` endpoint of the `facilitator server`.
6. `Facilitator server` performs verification of the object based on the `scheme` and `networkId` of the `Payment Payload` and returns a `Verification Response`
7. If the `Verification Response` is valid, the resource server performs the work to fulfill the request. If the `Verification Response` is invalid, the resource server returns a `402 Payment Required` status and a `Payment Required Response` JSON object in the response body.
8. `Resource server` either settles the payment by interacting with a blockchain directly, or by POSTing the `Payment Payload` and `Payment Details` to the `/settle` endpoint of the `facilitator server`.
9. `Facilitator server` submits the payment to the blockchain based on the `scheme` and `networkId` of the `Payment Payload`.
10. `Facilitator server` waits for the payment to be confirmed on the blockchain.
11. `Facilitator server` returns a `Payment Execution Response` to the resource server.
12. `Resource server` returns a `200 OK` response to the `Client` with the resource they requested as the body of the HTTP response, and a `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header containing the `Settlement Response` as Base64 encoded JSON if the payment was executed successfully.
