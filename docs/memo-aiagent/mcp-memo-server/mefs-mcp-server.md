# MEFS-MCP-SERVER

MEMO MCP Server provides a standard storage interface for AI agents, allowing AI agents to save generated content to MEFS and providing data retrieval capabilities. It provides decentralized storage for AI agents.

## Use Cases

- Encrypted data storage: Store AI-generated content to MEFS.
- User context retrieval: Store user behavior and preference data to MEFS, and quickly retrieve relevant user data in subsequent requests to provide to AI agents.
- Seamless data sharing: AI agents can achieve trustless data sharing through content identifiers (CID).

        name: "document.pdf", 
    });
```

Parameters:

- `file`: Base64-encoded file content
- `name`: Filename with extension
