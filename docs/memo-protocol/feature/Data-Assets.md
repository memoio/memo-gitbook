# Data Assets

Data Assets are a new type of asset based on the ERC-3130 protocol, designed for managing personal data. By tokenizing personal data, it ensures data sovereignty while unlocking the true value of the data.

## Features of Data Assets

- **Data Privacy**: Through various privacy protection mechanisms, the security and privacy of personal data can be ensured throughout its lifecycle.
- **Integrity of Data Sovereignty**: With additional proof mechanisms, the integrity of on-chain metadata and off-chain encrypted personal data can be guaranteed.
- **Full Release of Data Value**: By monetizing data, users can enjoy the value of their data while ensuring ownership. Adding various data permissions after monetization amplifies the value of data assets.

## Importance of Data Assets

- **Empowerment of Users**: Combining decentralized technology, the sovereignty of data assets is given to users. Users have the right to update and transfer permissions for their data.
- **Solving Data Silo Issues**: By leveraging decentralized technology, data can circulate, be shared, and even generate more valuable new data across multiple decentralized systems.
- **Privacy Protection**: Employing various privacy protection technologies ensures that user data is only visible to the user and authorized entities throughout its lifecycle, whether during data storage, transmission, or usage.
- **Support for Decentralized Applications**: Data is the foundation of various decentralized systems, and Data Assets can support any decentralized application.
