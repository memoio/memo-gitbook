# Feature

This section mainly introduces the features of the MEMO protocol.

- **User Centric**: The MEMO protocol is centered around the user, with its design and operational mechanisms always placing the rights, experience, and data sovereignty of the user at the core.
- **Decentralized Identity**: The decentralized identifiers provided by the MEMO protocol allow users to fully control their own identities and data while interacting seamlessly with decentralized platforms.
- **Data Availability**: The modular data layer provided by the MEMO protocol continuously provides proofs of data availability for on-chain data publication.
- **Data Assets**: The on-chain data assets provided by the MEMO protocol fully unleash the value of data. Data Availability is used to ensure consistency and integrity both on-chain and off-chain.
