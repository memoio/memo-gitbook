# User-Centric

MEMO is a user-centric modular data layer, whose design and operation mechanism always puts the user's rights, experience and data sovereignty at the core. The following are the core concepts of MEMO:

## **1. Data sovereignty belongs to users**

- **User control**: In MEMO's modular data architecture, users have full control over their own data. Users can decide how to store, share and trade data without relying on centralized platforms.

- **Privacy protection**: Through encryption and decentralized design, users' data access and sharing are only carried out under authorization, ensuring data privacy and security.

## **2. Economic rights belong to users**

- **Data assetization**: MEMO provides a data trading market, allowing users to trade their data transparently and securely and obtain economic value from it.

- **Benefit distribution**: Users are not only the owners of the data, but can also get rewards by participating in the network (such as storage nodes or data contributions), thereby directly benefiting from the ecosystem.

## **3. Flexible and convenient user experience**

- **Modular architecture**: MEMO's modular design allows users to choose specific functional modules according to their needs, such as storage (MEFS, ETHDrive, LensDrive), computing (Grid), and data management (Data Market, Data Wallet), reducing redundant complexity.

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Based on MEMO's DID and decentralized protocols, users can easily operate between different DApps and Web3 platforms, avoiding the trouble of multiple identity management.

## **4. Support user participation in governance**

- **Decentralized governance**: The MEMO network gives users decision-making power through DAO and other governance mechanisms, enabling them to directly participate in the platform's development planning and rule-making.

- **Transparency and trust**: All governance processes are open and transparent, and users can understand and influence the operation of the network.

## **5. Reduce usage costs**

- **Optimize costs**: Through modular design and efficient network operation, MEMO minimizes storage and data processing costs and reduces the economic burden on users.

- **Diversified services**: MEMO provides different levels of services, and users can choose cost-effective solutions according to their needs.

MEMO is user-centric because it allows users to take the initiative in the storage, management, transaction and use of data, protect user privacy and improve the user experience, while making users the core driving force of the network ecology through economic incentives and governance participation.
