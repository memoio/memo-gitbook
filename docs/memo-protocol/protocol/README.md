## MEMO Protocol

The MEMO Protocol is divided into six layers, ensuring data security and privacy throughout the data life cycle, allowing users to use, share their data across decentralized applications, and benefit from the value of their data.

- **Execution Layer**: The execution layer of MEMO is a key component of the MEMO network, responsible for processing transactions and executing smart contracts. It ensures the validity and consistency of transactions in the blockchain system and works in conjunction with the data availability layer to provide the necessary data access and verification.
- **Identity Layer**: The identity layer of MEMO is a crucial part of the MEMO decentralized ecosystem, aimed at supporting user data sovereignty and application interoperability by providing secure, efficient, and cross-platform digital identity solutions.
- **Smart Layer**: The smart layer of MEMO focuses on providing distributed, efficient, self-driven, and low-cost data hosting services for modern internet applications. It supports the smooth migration of Web 2.0 applications to Web 3.0 and provides robust infrastructure support for emerging Web 3.0 applications.
- **Data Storage Layer**: The data storage layer of MEMO offers highly flexible and scalable data storage solutions, allowing users to choose different data storage options based on the importance of their data, ensuring data storage security.
- **Computation Layer**: The computation layer of MEMO employs Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to ensure that personal data is executed in a private and highly secure environment, and after computation, TEE proofs are published to the chain, guaranteeing data privacy and security.
- **Validation Layer**: The validation layer of MEMO plays a crucial role in ensuring that all layers operate decentralized, securely, and normally. Anyone can become a validator and provide security for the operation of the MEMO protocol. The work of validators includes verifying TEE proofs, verifying DA proofs, etc.
