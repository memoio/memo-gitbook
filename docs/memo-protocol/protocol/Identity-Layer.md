# Identity Layer

The Identity Layer is a key part of the MEMO decentralized ecosystem, designed to support user data sovereignty and application interoperability by providing secure, efficient and cross-platform digital identity solutions.

MEMO has built an innovative Identity Layer by integrating account DID (memo did), file DID (mfile did) and device DID (mdevice did), providing a comprehensive and efficient identity management and authentication solution for the decentralized data ecosystem.

In the data layer, entities such as users, devices, and files need to have unique identities to avoid data conflicts or false identities. Traditional systems usually rely on centralized services for identity authentication, while in the data layer, the Identity Layer is based on blockchain and eliminates the reliance on centralized authentication services.

The Identity Layer gives each data object (such as files, transaction records) a unique identifier (such as file DID) to support the storage, sharing and asset management of data. Data transactions require clear ownership and access rights. The Identity Layer ensures that the transaction process is transparent, the data source is credible, and asset disputes are avoided.

In the data layer, data storage and access require fine-grained control based on identity, such as allowing specific users or devices to access specific data. Identity Layer provides a mechanism for dynamically adjusting permissions to support more complex scenario requirements. Through encryption and selective disclosure functions, users can share identity information or data as needed while protecting sensitive information.

The data layer not only processes data, but also involves collaboration between users and devices. Identity Layer provides account DID, file DID, and device DID to manage user identities, data files, and IoT devices respectively, forming an efficient and collaborative ecosystem. Identity Layer follows the W3C DID standard and seamlessly connects with other modules or external systems, expanding the scope of application of the data layer.

Governance in the data layer usually relies on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Identity Layer ensures that each participant has an independent and trusted identity and binds governance rights, such as voting or proposals. Through on-chain records and identity verification, all governance activities are traceable, enhancing the transparency of the decentralized ecosystem.

In addition, Identity Layer also supports IoT and edge computing scenarios. The Identity Layer provides a unified identity management solution through device DID, supporting device access, data sharing and remote control. Through blockchain and device DID, secure data exchange can be achieved between devices without relying on centralized servers.

## Account DID

Account DID (Decentralized Identifier) ​​is a key module for managing user identity and data in the MEMO ecosystem. The role of account DID is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1. Decentralized identity management

* Unique identification: Account DID generates a unique identifier for each user to ensure that the identity can be accurately identified in the MEMO network and its compatible Web3 platform.

* Data autonomy: Users have full control over their own DIDs, can independently manage identities and associated data, and get rid of the monopoly of identity data by traditional centralized systems.

2. Cross-platform identity interoperability

* Compatibility: Account DID follows the W3C DID standard and achieves interoperability with other blockchain networks and DApps. Users can log in and operate seamlessly on multiple platforms with the same DID.
* Unified management: Through one DID, users can manage all activities related to their identity, reducing the complexity brought by multiple accounts.

3. Data privacy and selective disclosure
* Privacy protection: Users can selectively disclose part of their identity information to specific DApps or platforms without sharing all data, thereby protecting privacy.
* Encryption verification: Through the public key encryption mechanism, DID data always remains secure during the sharing process to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

4. Support decentralized data economy
* Data assetization: Account DID combined with data storage modules (such as ETHDrive) and data trading markets enables users to mark and trade their own data to ensure asset ownership and transaction transparency.
* Authorized access: DID combined with smart contracts can manage data access rights in a fine-grained manner to ensure that only authorized users can access data.

## File DID

File DID (Decentralized Identifier) ​​is an important tool for managing file identity and access rights, designed to ensure file security, traceability and decentralized storage management. It plays the following key roles in MEMO's data ecosystem:

1. Unique file identification
* File uniqueness: Each file obtains a unique identifier through the file DID, ensuring that it can be uniquely identified and distinguished throughout the network.
* Decentralized storage: File DID is integrated with MEMO's storage system (such as EthDrive or MEFS) so that files can be securely distributed and stored without relying on centralized storage services.

2. File traceability
* On-chain records: The creation, modification, and sharing records of each file will be recorded in an unalterable manner on the blockchain through the file DID, improving transparency and credibility.

3. Data access rights management
* Fine-grained permission control: File DID combined with smart contracts can achieve precise permission management. For example, file owners can grant specific users the permission to view, download, or edit files through file DID.
* Dynamic authorization: File DID supports flexible permission adjustment, allowing file owners to dynamically change access rules as needed.

4. Data assetization and transaction
* Data asset tagging: Through file DID, files can be marked as specific data assets and traded in MEMO's data trading market.
* Transaction security: File DID ensures the authenticity and transparency of data transactions, while protecting file content from unauthorized users through encryption technology.

5. Cross-platform interoperability
* Standardization compatibility: File DID follows the decentralized identifier standard and is compatible with other blockchains and Web3 platforms. Users can share files on different platforms through file DID to ensure interoperability and ease of use.
* Data circulation: File DID enables file data to circulate securely and efficiently between different decentralized networks.

6. Enhanced file security and privacy protection
* Data encryption: File DID cooperates with encryption mechanism to ensure the security of file content during storage and transmission.
* Access privacy: Through file DID, file owners can achieve privacy-friendly data sharing and disclose file content only to authorized users.

## Device DID

Device DID (Decentralized Identifier) ​​is a decentralized identifier designed for device management and identity authentication. It gives devices a unique identity and enables interconnection and data sharing between devices in a decentralized network. The role of device DID is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1. Unique device identification
* Decentralized unique identity: Each device obtains a unique identity through the device DID, which can be identified in the network without relying on a centralized server.

* Prevent device forgery: The device DID ensures the authenticity of the identification through on-chain storage and encryption technology to prevent the device identity from being forged or tampered with.

2. Secure device authentication
* Device credibility verification: The device DID is combined with the public key mechanism in the blockchain to perform encrypted verification of the device identity and ensure the security of device access.

* Distributed trust system: Through a decentralized approach, devices can participate in network interactions without relying on centralized certification agencies.

3. Data sharing and collaboration
* Efficient communication between devices: Device DID provides a standardized communication method for devices, enabling them to seamlessly exchange data in a decentralized network.
* Device authorization access: Through device DID and smart contracts, precise data access permissions can be set for different devices to ensure the security and privacy of data sharing.

4. Support Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios
* IoT network management: Device DID is very suitable for use in the IoT ecosystem, providing device identity, data transmission encryption and permission management functions.
* Decentralized control: Traditional IoT systems rely on centralized servers, while device DID achieves distributed management through blockchain to improve the network's risk resistance.

5. Data traceability and device management
* Device activity tracking: Device DID records the operating status and interaction history of the device, making the device's activities traceable on the blockchain and improving transparency.
* Decentralized device updates: Through device DID, decentralized firmware upgrades and function updates can be performed on the device, reducing the risk of relying on centralized servers.

6. Cross-ecosystem interoperability
* Compatibility: Device DID follows the decentralized identifier standard and can work seamlessly with different blockchain networks and decentralized applications (DApps).
* Multi-platform support for device identity: Whether within the MEMO ecosystem or other compatible networks, device DID can ensure the mutual recognition and use of device identity.

The integrated application of MEMO's account DID, file DID and device DID in the Identity Layer breaks the limitations of traditional identity management and provides a flexible, efficient and secure solution. This not only promotes data assetization and decentralized governance, but also releases huge potential in the Internet of Things, data economy and Web3 applications.

The Identity Layer is the core component of the data layer. It ensures that the identity of users, data and devices in the decentralized network is authentic, the permissions are clear and the interaction is efficient. By providing unique identifiers, dynamic permission control and privacy protection mechanisms, the Identity Layer not only improves the flexibility and security of the data layer, but also provides key support for Web3 applications, the Internet of Things and decentralized governance. This identity management method lays the foundation for the widespread application of the data layer.
