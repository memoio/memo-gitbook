# Execution Layer

**MEMO's execution layer** is a key component in the MEMO network, responsible for handling transactions and smart contract execution. It ensures the validity and consistency of transactions in the blockchain system, and works with the data availability layer to provide the required data access and verification.

Through MEMOLayer2 and other layer 1 networks, the execution layer can support and optimize intermediary-free data transactions and data asset exchanges. It enables data providers across multiple blockchain networks to share the data they own on their respective chains and conveniently assetize data.

The core functions of the MEMO execution layer include processing settlement information on the chain, recording metadata information of data storage, data verification related information, data asset information, and decentralized identity information, and after reaching a consensus among validators, it can distribute rewards to system stakers and provide rich services to system participants. The execution layer needs to charge stake lock fees for some service providers to ensure the security and reliability of the service.

Through MEMO Meegrez and MEMOLayer2, the execution layer enhances the scalability and security of on-chain transactions and reduces transaction costs. MEMO's execution layer is an important part of the MEMO ecosystem.
