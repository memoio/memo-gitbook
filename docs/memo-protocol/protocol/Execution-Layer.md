# Execution Layer

**MEMO's execution layer** is a key component in the MEMO network, responsible for handling transactions and smart contract execution. It ensures the validity and consistency of transactions in the blockchain system, and works with the data availability layer to provide the required data access and verification.

The execution layer can support and optimize intermediary-free data transactions and data asset exchanges. It enables data providers across multiple blockchain networks to share the data they own on their respective chains and conveniently assetize data.

The core functions of the MEMO execution layer include processing settlement information on the chain, recording metadata information of data storage, data verification related information, data asset information, and decentralized identity information, and after reaching a consensus among validators, it can distribute rewards to system stakers and provide rich services to system participants. The execution layer needs to charge stake lock fees for some service providers to ensure the security and reliability of the service.

Through MEMO Meegrez, the execution layer enhances the scalability and security of on-chain transactions and reduces transaction costs. MEMO's execution layer is an important part of the MEMO ecosystem.

Meeda, as the Data Availability Service of MEMO, provides a communication channel between the execution layer and the data availability layer in the modular architecture of MEMO, ensuring that data can be smoothly read and verified by the execution layer. The execution layer needs to verify the data related to transactions and calculations. Meeda ensures the integrity and availability of the data and provides a reliable data foundation for execution. By outsourcing the data availability work to Meeda, the execution layer focuses on calculation and logic processing, greatly improving the overall performance. Meeda provides fast data retrieval and verification services, reduces data access latency at the execution layer, and optimizes transaction confirmation speed. The existence of Meeda enables the execution layer of MEMO to flexibly interact with different modules without directly dealing with the complexity of underlying data storage and verification.

In the execution layer of MEMO, Meeda not only ensures the availability and integrity of data, but also supports the rapid operation of the execution layer through efficient data interaction. Its existence makes the architecture of the modular data layer more flexible, ensures that the MEMO system operates efficiently and securely in a decentralized ecosystem, and provides a reliable infrastructure for Web3 applications.
