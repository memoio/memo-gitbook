# Distribution

## Initial Coin Distribution

The total supply of $MEMO will be 300,000,000, the allocation of the total supply is as follows:

The coin distribution ratio can be adjusted according to actual circumstances.

+ Foundation Account: 15%, for technology and ecosystem development.

+ Investors: 10%.

+ Liquidity Account: 15% for airdrops and trading

+ Incentive Account: 60%, for paying incentives to the staking pool.

## Incentive Release from the PledgePool

+ Incentive factor A, initially set to 1; the current total storage time is st, and the current total storage capacity is s; if st/max(s, 100TB) > 1 year; unlock A=1.2; if st/max(s, 1PB) > 1 year; unlock A=1.5; if st/max(s, 10PB) > 1 year; unlock A=2; Encourage everyone to increase storage to unlock a higher proportion, thereby increasing the reward cap;

+ Incentive amount, the total amount currently needed to pay for storage is m, the average storage duration is T, and if there is t time without allocated rewards, then the incentive is Amt/T.

At the beginning, increase storage to unlock a higher incentive ratio and obtain higher incentive returns;
When rewards are high, that is, when the storage market is large, token holders will tend to put their tokens into the staking pool to increase income, thereby reducing market liquidity and increasing token price; suppressing new storage demand.

## Cold Start

+ Airdrop to user accounts for paying storage fees (by directly hitting the settlement pool, with usage restrictions).

+ Airdrop to keeper/provider accounts for staking.
